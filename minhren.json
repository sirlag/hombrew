The interior is a pleasant temperature and is adorned with a large, low table and simple yet soft pillows and cushion to sit on. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out or, if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to where the vessel formally was. You can remain inside the vessel up to the number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You cannot do this again until you finish a long rest.",
